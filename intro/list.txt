# Using xmq to generate html is beneficial since whitespace is explicit, there will be no whitespace between the img tags, despite them being spread out over multiple lines. If you try to do the same when writing html directly you will get whitespace in the rendered page. When xmq generates html it will not pretty print. If pretty printing is requested anyway, then xmq will try to avoid to add pretty printing that introduces visible whitespace in the rendered page.
