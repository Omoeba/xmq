2024-12-07: Release 3.0.0

XMQ now supports invisible XML (IXML). Read https://invisiblexml.org/

Try:
xmq --ixml=grammar.ixml input_file

or for quicker testing, the input can be provided as an argument:
xmq --ixml=grammar.ixml -i 'text to parse'

The implementation of the IXML standard is not yet complete,
but it has reached a useful state!
